// /js/navigation.js
// ============================================================================
// This file used to contain an entire second navigation system — a
// desktop/tablet sidebar with its own hamburger, overlay, and nav-item
// markup (buildNavigationStructure, populateSidebarNav, populateBottomNav,
// toggleSidebar, and the rest). None of it was ever wired up: nothing in
// the app calls initNavigation(), so it never ran. The actual, live
// navigation is the bottom tab bar and the hamburger drawer defined
// directly in index.html, driven by ui.js (setActiveNav) and
// mobileNavDrawer.js (open/close behavior).
//
// The one thing here that WAS genuinely used — applyPermittedSections,
// imported by settings.js — is kept, with a real bug fixed: it was
// querying for `.nav-item, .bottom-nav-item`, classes that only exist on
// the 5-item bottom tab bar. The full hamburger drawer's links (all 17+
// sections, including sensitive ones like Loans and Properties) have no
// class at all, so a restricted family member's drawer was never actually
// being filtered — they could see and open every section regardless of
// their permissions, even though the bottom tab bar correctly hid theirs.
// Querying by the data-view attribute instead — which every real nav link
// in both the bottom bar and the drawer consistently has — fixes both at
// once and doesn't depend on class names matching.
// ============================================================================

import { getPermittedSections } from './familySync.js';

// Hide nav items outside a restricted family member's allowed sections.
// When not connected to a family server (getPermittedSections() returns
// null) or logged in as the admin (sections includes '*'), nothing is
// hidden. This is enforcement-in-depth alongside the server itself
// refusing to sync data for sections a user isn't permitted — hiding the
// nav item here is about a clean experience, not the actual security
// boundary (that's server-side).

    const allowed = !isRestricted || sections.includes(view);
    item.style.display = allowed ? '' : 'none';
    // For <li><a data-view>...</a></li> structures (the hamburger drawer),
    // hiding just the <a> still leaves an empty list item taking up space —
    // hide the parent <li> too when present.
